==========
Special thanks for Lars Doucet for his definitive tutorial on Automated Transparent Development.  You can read it at https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/LarsDoucet/20150401/240254/Automated_Transparent_Development.php

This repo doesn't have any code, it's just a convenient dumping ground for any issues users might find in the test builds for Blast Pulser.

#Instructions (for testers)

###1. Log in / Sign up for a Github account
You'll need a Github account to report issues and bugs.

###2. Follow along at https://waffle.io/WarpZone32/bpbugs
Waffle.io is a more convenient interface for viewing github issues. However, you can also just use this repository directly to view the raw data, and to report new stuff.

###2.a. Ask to become a collaborator if you're really serious
Normal users can't add labels and do much besides create and comment on issues. But if you really, really, like hanging out on our bugtracker for some reason, I can make you a collaborator and give you more power. It's like being a forum moderator, but for bug tracking. Just ping me @WarpZone32 in some issue comment if you're into this sort of thing.

###3. Learn how to report a bug! *This is very important!*

In order to fix a bug, we have to be able to reproduce the error or problem you've encountered.

Therefore, please follow the example format below.

(Or just take a look at the [EXAMPLE ISSUE](https://github.com/larsiusprime/tdrpg-bugs/issues/1))

#####BASIC INFORMATION:

*Version # is at the bottom-right of the title screen
**Optional info is just anything else you think might be important
```

*This information lets us know which build/version of the game has a problem*

#####STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
```
1. Start a "New Game"
2. Beat the first level 
   (I placed the berserker, boosted him once, 
    and set speed to "2x")
3. Exit the reward screen from the first battle
4. Click on the second level, click "start"
