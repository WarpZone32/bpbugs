**Special thanks to Lars Doucet for his definitive tutorial on Automated Transparent Development.  You can read it at https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/LarsDoucet/20150401/240254/Automated_Transparent_Development.php**

This repo doesn't have any code, it's just a convenient dumping ground for any issues users might find in the test builds for Blast Pulser.

#Instructions (for testers)

###1. Log in / Sign up for a Github account
You'll need a Github account to report issues and bugs.

###2. Follow along at https://waffle.io/WarpZone32/bpbugs
Waffle.io is a more convenient interface for viewing github issues. However, you can also just use this repository directly to view the raw data, and to report new stuff.

###3. Learn how to report a bug! *This is very important!*

In order to fix a bug, we have to be able to reproduce the error or problem you've encountered.

Therefore, please follow the example format below.

(Or just take a look at the [EXAMPLE ISSUE](https://github.com/larsiusprime/tdrpg-bugs/issues/1))

1. Start a "New Game"
2. Beat the first level

    and set speed to "2x")
